//** Create a class that models a GroceryItem
//For our class GroceryItem model, we will say that each one has a name (String), selling price (double) and may have an expiration date (String)
//Create the class with the following functions:
//Set/get methods for each property
//1 default and 2 other constructors of your choice â€“ determine your own default values as you see fit
//1 predicate method to see if the GroceryItem is expensive (defined as the selling price is greater than a given price)
//Next, write a main program that creates at least 2 GroceryItem objects and tests all functions designed
